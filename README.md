This is part of a class project for CS250. This is week 8 Journal. In this we had to answer the following question and my answer will be listed bellow each question. 

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I did this through role of tester, by asking them question it gave a lay to not only what they wanted but what they need as well to be consider a successful. The "user stories" helps develop lay out a list of thier wants and needs,
allow the tester to put in number of important. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I have seen one of best way to approach programing is put myself in place of user as far function ability, as well try simplif it to make easy to read and edit later on. 
I plan on using agile processes to get feedback not only from Scrum master but help from tester complete the user stories.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member mean not only completing your work, but also giving feedback to other as need. It also means stepping in when you know you can help but understand your helping and not in charge. Overstepping your baundaries can be
more hurtful than good to a project. It also understand at times you might get feedback that you may not want to hear, but understand it come from someone who mostly care for you as well the project.
